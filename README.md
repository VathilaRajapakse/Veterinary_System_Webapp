#### Brief Description of Project -
Veterinary hospital management is a web-based application designed for making tasks 
convenient in handling problems related to pets, all the specific problems will be solved 
with the integration of all the tasks that needs to be performed to take care of a pet.

The main problem we have focused was providing a clear path for effective 
communication between the two parties and to maintain data efficiency, get rid of data 
redundancy and keep records of the pets their breed, owner of the pet, and other essential 
information regarding the pet.

We have taken all the above into consideration and we have introduced a system to 
provide comfort to the pet as well as the owner of the pet since it's important to keep the 
pet loss crisis down, we have also come up with solutions to make sure the owner of the 
pets will have maximum efficiency in time saving, having a cost-effective mechanism, 
and to provide the client with urgent care with the best available service.

We have concluded that this system is important in Saving lives of a dozen of pets so 
therefore we are ready to provide this web app to any veterinary institution who would
seek our service in the near future.
